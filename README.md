### User Authentication
The app uses  [Django Rest Auth](https://django-rest-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for authenticating users using API. Login, signup, change password, and logout are handled by this modile. Some configuration are set by [Django Allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) in the backend.

### Site architecture
- Landing Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/: Serve as the home page of the application and for   triggering the automatic DB population that generates six users and with three users already have ten items created available for sale. Re-population of users and items owned by users was initiated by using Django's *post_save [signals](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/signals/)* in the users app.

- Shop Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/shop: The page to view the available products available for sale that return ten items per page. Paginated using DRF's [PageNumber pagination class](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/#pagenumberpagination) with page size of 10 and *[react-js-pagination](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-js-pagination)*. Authenticated and anonymous users can view all of the items for sales but only the login users can shop and can create _merchandise_ objects as item for sale.

- Login Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/login: User must provide email and password to be submitted in the form.

- Signup Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/signup: To register a user, username, email, and password with confirmation must be fullfilled.

- Account Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/account: For editing user's password.

- MyItem Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/myitems: Page where authenticated users can view their own items, sold items and bought item. The add item form and edit item form was also found in this page.

- Logout Page https://nurtsrx.herokuapp.com/logout: All authenticated users must logout to delete all the local storage data in the browser.

### Search
Anonymous and login users can search the items by the item's title using *title field* as search field and [search filters](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter).
